## About
Bitident enables your users to use a decentralized way to authenticate with your application. By using the Metaverse public Blockchain there is no need for a 3rd party to validate your 2 factor authentication request. Still your user will be able to use one identity to authenticate to multiple systems or create multiple identities for different purposes.

Try our solution by entering your Metaverse Avatar name and create an authentication request. If you don't have an Avatar visit MyETPWallet download the wallet and register your first Digital Identity on the Blockchain.

Bitident authentication relies on digital signatures of Metaverse Avatars private keys. Because the address of each Avatar is publicly available on the Blockchain everybody can independently verify the signatures.

We will soon publish our development kit that will enable everybody to easily integrate Metaverse backed authentication into every web-based application. You can already find our [Bitident JavaScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bitident) library on npm.
