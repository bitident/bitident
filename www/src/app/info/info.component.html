<h1>Decentralized Authentication</h1>
<p>
  Bitident enables your users to use a decentralized way to authenticate with your application.
  By using the Metaverse public Blockchain there is no need to store authentication secrets nor
  rely on 3rd parties to validate authentication requests. Still your user will be able to use 
  one identity to authenticate to multiple systems or create multiple identities for different 
  purposes.
</p>
<p>
  Try our solution by entering your Metaverse Avatar name and create an authentication request. If you don't
  have an Avatar visit <a href="https://myetpwallet.com" target="blank">MyETPWallet</a> download the wallet and
  register your first Digital Identity on the Blockchain.
</p>
<p>
  Bitident authentication relies on digital signatures of Metaverse Avatars private keys. Because the address of
  each Avatar is publicly available on the Blockchain everybody can independently verify the signatures.
</p>
<p>
  We will soon publish our development kit that will enable everybody to easily integrate Metaverse backed
  authentication into every web-based application.
